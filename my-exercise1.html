<p> Nasa is to launch a new zero-gravity toilet for testing at the International <br>
    Space Station (ISS) before its probable use in a future mission to the <br>
    <br>
    The $23m (Â£17.8m) toilet, which sucks waste from the body, will be sent to the <br>
    station on a cargo ship. <br>
    <br>
    Nasa said the toilet's "vacuum system" was designed for the comfort of female <br>
    astronauts, unlike previous models. <br>
    <br>
    A rocket carrying the cargo ship was supposed to blast off from Wallops Island <br>
    Virginia, on Thursday <br>
    <br>
    But the mission was aborted less than three minutes before lift off because of <br>
    technical difficulties. <br>
    <br>
    Another launch attempt is due on Friday evening if engineers can fix the issues that <br>
    caused Thursday's delay. <br>
