            new $23m toilet at space station</h1></header>

            <small>The launch of Northrop Grumman's Antares rocket was delayed on Thursday after technical issues</small> <br>
            <br>
            <p> <strong>Nasa is to launch a new zero-gravity toilet for testing at the International <br>
            Space Station (ISS) before its probable use in a future mission to the</strong>  <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            The $23m (£17.8m) toilet, which sucks waste from the body, will be sent to the <br>
            station on a cargo ship. <br>
            <br>
            Nasa said the toilet's "vacuum system" was designed for the comfort of female <br>
            astronauts, unlike previous models. <br>
            <br>
            A rocket carrying the cargo ship was supposed to blast off from Wallops Island <br>
            Virginia, on Thursday <br>
            <br>
            But the mission was aborted less than three minutes before lift off because of <br>
            technical difficulties. <br>
            <br>
            Another launch attempt is due on Friday evening if engineers can fix the issues that <br>
            caused Thursday's delay. <br>

            On board will be the Universal Waste Management System (UWMS), the new <br>
            titanium space toilet that Nasa says will help astronauts "boldly go" during deep- <br>
            space missions. <br>
            <br>
            The toilet uses a vacuum system to suck waste away from the body in a zero- <br>
            gravity environment. For privacy, the toilet is located inside a cubicle - just like in a <br>
            public bathroom on Earth. <br>
            <br>
            <img src="nasa2.png" alt="nasa2"><br>
            <small>The toilet is located inside a stall on the space station</small> <br>
            <br>
            Nasa says the toilet represents an upgrade on the current facilities in the US part of <br>
            the ISS. <br>
            <br>
            Weighing 45kg (100lbs) and standing 28in (71cm) tall, the toilet is 65% smaller and <br>
            40% lighter than the one currently in use. <br>
            <br>
            Designers also gave more consideration to the comfort of female astronauts. <br>
            <br>
            "[A] big part of our project was optimising the use of the toilet for the female crew," <br>
            Melissa McKinley, a Nasa project manager, <strong><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/international-space-station-23-million-female-toilet/"> told the BBC's US partner CBS <br>
            News. <br></a></strong>
            <br>
            "Nasa spent a lot of time working with the crew members and doing evaluations to <br>
            improve the use of the commode seat and the urine funnel to make it more <br>
            accommodating to use by female crew members" she said. <br>
            <br>
            <img src="nasa3.jpg" alt="toilet"> <br>
            <small>The toilet has been designed with female astronauts in mind</small> <br>
            <br>
            These design improvements will be put to the test on the ISS before they are <br>
            eventually built into <strong><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/extra/nkzysaP3pB/to-the-moon-and-beyond">Orion capsules that will carry astronauts to the Moon. <br></a></strong> 
            <br>
            A successful dry run, in every sense of the term, is what astronauts are hoping for. <br>
            <br>
            <strong><a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-spacex-archive-moon-f06581fe70515ae7608304af8e6a44fb">"Cleaning up a mess is a big deal. We don't want any misses or escapes,"</a></strong>  Ms <br>
            McKinley told the Associated Press news agency. <br>
            <br>
            Northrop Grumman's Antares rocket will deliver the new toilet as part of a cargo run <br>
            consisting of science equipment, crew supplies and spare parts. <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h2>How do space toilets work?</h2> <br>
            <strong><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/boldly-go-nasa-s-new-space-toilet-offers-more-comfort-improved-efficiency-for-deep-space">Space toilets "use air flow to pull urine and faeces away from the body and <br>
            into the proper receptacles"</a></strong> , according to Nasa. <br>    
            <br>
            In a video posted to Twitter, Nasa astronaut Jessica Meir described the toilet as a <br>
            "vacuum system". <br>
            <br>
            "So imagine you have a vacuum cleaner and you're sucking things down. You turn <br>
            on a big fan, so that's pulling everything down inside the toilet," she said. <br>
            <br>
            There is a specially shaped funnel for urine and a seat for bowel movements, which <br>
            can be used simultaneously. <br>
            <br>
            "The UWMS seat may look uncomfortably small and pointy, but in microgravity it's <br>
            ideal," Nasa said. "It provides ideal body contact to make sure everything goes <br>
            where it should." <br>
            <br>
            When sat on the toilet, astronauts can use foot restraints and handholds to keep <br>
            themselves from floating away. <br>
            <br>
            The toilet can process and recycle urine as drinking water for the astronauts. As Ms <br>
            Meir said, on the ISS "today's coffee is tomorrow's coffee". <br>
            <br>
            Faecal waste is not given the same treatment, but Nasa says it is studying this <br>
            capability. <br>
            <br>
            "Just like everything else, going to the bathroom in space is something that you <br>
            have to get used to," Ms Meir said. <br>
