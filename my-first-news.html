             <br>

             <small>President Trump headed on Thursday to a fund-raiser at the Trump National Golf Club <br>
                 in Bedminster, N.J. Hours later, he announced that he had tested positive for the <br>
                 coronavirus. <br></small>

    <p><small>Oct. 2, 2020</small><br>
        <br>
        WASHINGTON — President Trump’s announcement on Friday <br>
        that he had contracted the coronavirus upended the presidential <br>
        race in an instant, leaving both sides to confront a wrenching set of <br>
        strategic choices and unexpected questions that will help shape the <br>
        final month before Election Day. <br>
        <br>
        As the president boarded Marine One to fly to the Walter Reed <br>
        National Military Medical Center for treatment, his aides <br>
        announced that they were suspending his campaign events and <br>
        those of his family members, who are his most ubiquitous <br>
        surrogates. Privately, his top advisers expressed shock at the turn <br>
        of events and hope that Mr. Trump’s symptoms would remain mild <br>
        and he could at least begin appearing on television next week. <br>
        <br>
        At the same time, Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Trump’s Democratic <br>
        rival, disclosed that he had tested negative for the virus and <br>
        continued to campaign, beginning with a campaign trip on Friday <br>
        to Michigan. <br>
        <br>
        With Mr. Biden already leading in the polls, and Mr. Trump’s <br>
        electoral prospects dependent on his ability to campaign, the <br>
        president has little time to change the trajectory of the race. The <br>
        fate of his re-election bid increasingly seemed to hinge on his own <br>
        health — and whether he will able to overcome the disease and <br>
        persuade voters to give him another four years. <br>
        <br>
        The split-screen between the candidates on Friday represented a <br>
        striking reversal from the last few months, during which Mr. <br>
        Trump pushed on with his rallies and belittled Mr. Biden for <br>
        adhering to health protocols and running a “basement campaign.” <br>
        <br>
        The former vice president was careful to avoid anything that could <br>
        be perceived as exploiting the situation Friday; at an appearance <br>
        in Grand Rapids, Mich., he did not criticize Mr. Trump for his <br>
        handling of the virus, and closed his remarks by calling on God to <br>
        “protect the first family, and every family that is dealing with this <br>
        virus.”<br>
        <br>
        Mr. Biden’s campaign also moved to take down negative television <br>
        commercials Friday that lashed Mr. Trump for his handling of the <br>
        virus, according to a Democratic official familiar with the ad traffic. <br>
        And Mr. Biden’s campaign manager, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, <br>
        emailed the entire campaign urging its members to “refrain from <br>
        posting about the situation on social media.”<br>
        <br>
        Mr. Biden’s aides said he had no plans to step away from his travels <br>
        — at least for now. <br>
        <br>
        The president’s illness is certain to keep the coronavirus pandemic <br>
        front and center in the remaining weeks before the election, a <br>
        development that would appear to favor Mr. Biden, whose <br>
        campaign message is focused on criticism of Mr. Trump’s <br>
        stewardship of the deadly disease. <br>
        <br>
        In the White House, advisers to the president acknowledged that <br>
        the positive test would remind voters of how dismissive Mr. Trump <br>
        had been about the virus, not only with the neglect of his own <br>
        safety but also in his overly rosy assessments about a pandemic <br>
        that has killed more than 208,000 Americans. Mr. Trump’s <br>
        recklessness, one adviser acknowledged, amounted to a political <br>
        “disaster.” <br>
        <br>
        For all the drama 2020 has delivered, the presidential race has <br>
        been largely impervious to even momentous events, whether it <br>
        was impeachment, the virus, unrest over racism and severe <br>
        economic distress. Mr. Biden has enjoyed a steady lead in the polls <br>
        since effectively claiming the nomination in April. <br>
        <br>
        But an incumbent president testing positive for a potentially <br>
        deadly disease is of a greater order of magnitude. <br>
        <br>
        Republicans worried on Friday that Mr. Trump would have to <br>
        remain in the hospital for a significant period of time, imagery they <br>
        fear would be damaging at a moment when millions of Americans <br>
        are already voting. <br>
        <br>
        G.O.P. officials were also concerned that a race with very few <br>
        undecided voters would freeze in place. Multiple party strategists <br>
        said their polling in the two nights after the presidential debate had <br>
        revealed substantial slippage, and not just at the top of the ticket. <br>
        <br>
        “This limits Trump’s opportunity to turn this thing around and <br>
        drive a winning message,” said Terry Sullivan, a Republican <br>
        consultant. “He’s lost any ability to control the narrative.” <br>
        <br>
        Should the final weeks of the campaign be dominated by the <br>
        coronavirus, Mr. Trump’s challenge will be intensified by his casual <br>
        approach to the disease and its deadliness. <br>
        <br>
        The president spent months disregarding and mocking the basic <br>
        precautions, such as wearing a mask, that his health advisers were <br>
        urging Americans to take to protect themselves. <br>
        <br>
        Still, few Democrats had any degree of confidence on how the final <br>
        weeks of the race would play out. <br>
        <br>
        Representative Dina Titus of Nevada said Mr. Biden should <br>
        proceed. “I don’t see why he should quit campaigning unless <br>
        something really bad happens,” Ms. Titus said. “And then all bets <br>
        are off.” <br>
        <br>
        What some Democrats feared, and Republicans hoped, is that there <br>
        would be a rallying around Mr. Trump and he would garner <br>
        sympathy from voters. Yet even the most optimistic Republican <br>
        allowed that those sentiments wouldn’t automatically translate into <br>
        votes. <br>
        <br>
        At the very least, Republicans said they hoped Mr. Trump’s illness <br>
        would prompt him to refrain from the inflammatory rhetoric that <br>
        has alienated many voters and make the election less of a <br>
        referendum on his behavior. <br>
        <br>
        “Peace and calm helps him,” said Alex Castellanos, a longtime <br>
        Republican strategist. “He is the polarizing element, not the <br>
        direction he would like to take the country.” <br>
        <br>
        Mr. Trump’s political fortunes will depend in large part on the <br>
        severity of his illness. Other world leaders, including Prime <br>
        Minister Boris Johnson of Britain, have been sickened by the virus <br>
        and returned to lead their countries. <br>
        <br>
        The 74-year-old president is older than his counterparts who have <br>
        contracted Covid-19, however, and they were not on the ballot when <br>
        they tested positive. <br>
        <br>
        In any event, the effect of even seemingly cataclysmic events on <br>
        the race are hard to predict. After all, when the “Access Hollywood” <br>
        video emerged just weeks before the election in 2016, it was widely <br>
        thought that Mr. Trump’s boast of grabbing women’s genitals would <br>
        effectively end his chances of winning. <br>
