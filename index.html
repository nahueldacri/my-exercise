                <small>The launch of Northrop Grumman's Antares rocket was delayed on Thursday after technical issues</small> <br>
                <p> <strong>Nasa is to launch a new zero-gravity toilet for testing at the International <br>
                Space Station (ISS) before its probable use in a future mission to the</strong></p>
                <p>The $23m (£17.8m) toilet, which sucks waste from the body, will be sent to the <br>
                station on a cargo ship. </p>
                <p>Nasa said the toilet's "vacuum system" was designed for the comfort of female <br>
                astronauts, unlike previous models.</p>            
                <p>A rocket carrying the cargo ship was supposed to blast off from Wallops Island <br>
                Virginia, on Thursday </p>
                <p>But the mission was aborted less than three minutes before lift off because of <br>
                technical difficulties. </p>
                <p>Another launch attempt is due on Friday evening if engineers can fix the issues that <br>
                caused Thursday's delay. </p>

                </ul>
                <p>On board will be the Universal Waste Management System (UWMS), the new <br>
                titanium space toilet that Nasa says will help astronauts "boldly go" during deep- <br>
                space missions. </p>
                <p>The toilet uses a vacuum system to suck waste away from the body in a zero- <br>
                gravity environment. For privacy, the toilet is located inside a cubicle - just like in a <br>
                public bathroom on Earth. </p>
                <img src="img/nasa2.png" alt="nasa2"><br>
                <small>The toilet is located inside a stall on the space station</small> <br>
                <p> Nasa says the toilet represents an upgrade on the current facilities in the US part of <br>
                the ISS. </p>
                <p>Weighing 45kg (100lbs) and standing 28in (71cm) tall, the toilet is 65% smaller and <br>
                40% lighter than the one currently in use. </p>
                <p>Designers also gave more consideration to the comfort of female astronauts. </p>
                <p>"[A] big part of our project was optimising the use of the toilet for the female crew," <br>
                Melissa McKinley, a Nasa project manager, <strong><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/international-space-station-23-million-female-toilet/"> told the BBC's US partner CBS <br>
                News. </p></a></strong>
                <p>"Nasa spent a lot of time working with the crew members and doing evaluations to <br>
                improve the use of the commode seat and the urine funnel to make it more <br>
                accommodating to use by female crew members" she said. </p>
                <img src="img/nasa3.jpg" alt="toilet"> <br>
                <small>The toilet has been designed with female astronauts in mind</small> <br>
                <p>These design improvements will be put to the test on the ISS before they are <br>
                eventually built into <strong><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/extra/nkzysaP3pB/to-the-moon-and-beyond">Orion capsules that will carry astronauts to the Moon. </p></a></strong> 
                <p>A successful dry run, in every sense of the term, is what astronauts are hoping for. </p>
                <p><strong><a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-spacex-archive-moon-f06581fe70515ae7608304af8e6a44fb">"Cleaning up a mess is a big deal. We don't want any misses or escapes,"</a></strong>  Ms <br>
                McKinley told the Associated Press news agency. </p>
                <p>Northrop Grumman's Antares rocket will deliver the new toilet as part of a cargo run <br>
                consisting of science equipment, crew supplies and spare parts. </p>
                <h2>How do space toilets work?</h2>
                <p><strong><a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/boldly-go-nasa-s-new-space-toilet-offers-more-comfort-improved-efficiency-for-deep-space">Space toilets "use air flow to pull urine and faeces away from the body and <br>
                into the proper receptacles"</a></strong> , according to Nasa. </p>    
                <p>In a video posted to Twitter, Nasa astronaut Jessica Meir described the toilet as a <br>
                "vacuum system". </p>
                <p>"So imagine you have a vacuum cleaner and you're sucking things down. You turn <br>
                on a big fan, so that's pulling everything down inside the toilet," she said. </p>
                <p>There is a specially shaped funnel for urine and a seat for bowel movements, which <br>
                can be used simultaneously.</p>
                <p>"The UWMS seat may look uncomfortably small and pointy, but in microgravity it's <br>
                ideal," Nasa said. "It provides ideal body contact to make sure everything goes <br>
                where it should." </p>
                <p>When sat on the toilet, astronauts can use foot restraints and handholds to keep <br>
                themselves from floating away. </p>
                <p>The toilet can process and recycle urine as drinking water for the astronauts. As Ms <br>
                Meir said, on the ISS "today's coffee is tomorrow's coffee". </p>
                <p>Faecal waste is not given the same treatment, but Nasa says it is studying this <br>
                capability. </p>
                <p>"Just like everything else, going to the bathroom in space is something that you <br>
                have to get used to," Ms Meir said. </p>
